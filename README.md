Project Requirements

To receive a passing grade on this project, you must meet the following requirements:

MUST: 12 Points

M1: The backend (BE) of the system must be an individual component.
M2: The frontend (FE) of the system must be an individual component implemented using HTML5, CSS and JS.
M3: The communication between FE and BE components must be implemented using HTTP(S).
M4: The communication between FE and BE components must be implemented using asynchronous data transfer (AJAX).
M5: The HTTP endpoints of the BE component must return the data either as JSON or as XML.
M6: The HTTP endpoints of the BE component must manage resources using HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, each method at least on one HTTP endpoint.
M7: The HTTP endpoints of the FE component must consume resources using HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE from at least one HTTP endpoint.
M8: The system must consume at least one external REST web service.
M9: The system must implement session management (Login, sessionID, JWT, ...)
SHOULD: 5 Points

After meeting all MUST requirements, you should fulfill the following requirements for the next 5 points:

S1: The system should consume at least two external REST web services.
S2: The system should offer a second individual FE component that communicates with at least three HTTP endpoints of the BE component.
S3: The FE component should be designed in a way that it is w3c compliant (https://validator.w3.org/)
COULD: 3 points

After meeting all MUST and SHOULD requirements, you may fulfill the following requirements for the final 3 points:

C1: The system could consume at least three external REST web services.
C2: The HTTP endpoints of the BE component could return the data as JSON and XML.
C3: The BE component of the system could provide a PATCH HTTP endpoint, which is consumed by the FE component.
Project Description

The Cosmic-Coasters website is a web application that includes both a frontend (FE) and a backend (BE) component. The FE component is implemented using HTML5, CSS, and JS and communicates with the BE component using HTTP(S) and asynchronous data transfer (AJAX). The BE component manages resources using HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE and returns data either as JSON or as XML.

The Cosmic-Coasters website also consumes at least one external REST web service and implements session management.

After fulfilling all MUST requirements, you may work towards fulfilling the SHOULD and COULD requirements for additional points.
